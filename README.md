# jkoshy

Per memory, my earliest contribution to open-source was in 1996 ([link](https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/src/commit/aea6ddfd4ff88bb3f78bd293ca8cce3442ce54fd)).

These days my open-source work is mostly at the [Elftoolchain][] project (which is hosted at [SourceForge.Net][] currently).  Apart from [Elftoolchain][] work, I am a committer at the [FreeBSD][] & [NetBSD][] open-source operating system projects.

My \*BSD related open-source work is browseable the [FreshBSD.org](https://freshbsd.org/?q=jkoshy) tracker site.
